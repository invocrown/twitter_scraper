= Twitter Scraper
This script scrapes a Twitter HTML page and converts it to Atom or RSS.

You can run it from the command line, as a CGI script or as WSGI (with 
WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}).

On the command line you can use a Twitter username or -s and a search string.

I've tried to use as few external libraries as possible. It requires 
BeautifulSoup 4 and PyRSS2Gen (if you want RSS).

I'm releasing this into the public domain, do what you like with it, but 
if you want to make a contribution you can send bitcoins to 
1rLaVLyzXLP46VbQnMHNFg6S8KqrcNZZN.

This meets my needs but has not been thoroughly tested, please contact me 
if you find any bugs. The RSS in particular needs more testing.

There is also JSON output, this is just for test purposes really, it bears no 
relation to any JSON feed generated by Twitter.

Note, use of this script violates Twitters terms of usage.
